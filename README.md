# Analysis-of-Query-Techniques-for-Large-Databases


In this project, I designed and implemented the commonly used parallel join techniques Fragment-and-Replicate as well as Symmetric Partitioning, using OpenMP. Using these parallel join techniques, I conducted performance analysis to measure and explain performance gaps that occur when parallelizing popular join algorithms, such as sort-merge join and hash-join. The performance of these algorithms are tested on a large dataset involving tables with over 10,000,000 entries.
